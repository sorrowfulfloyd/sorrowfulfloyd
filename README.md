## About me

I'm sorrowfulfloyd, a tech enthusiast, and I'm on a journey of transformation from a background in electronics repair to software development.

Here's a little bit about me:

🔧 In the past, I was involved in electronics repair, primarily focusing on fixing computers, TVs, and mobile phones. I also enjoyed tinkering with circuits and delving into the intricate workings of electronic devices, all from my very own shop. 

🚀 However, now I have closed my own shop and decided to dive into software development.

## My journey

- A few years ago, I dabbled in programming as a hobby, but I quickly lost motivation due to a lack of clear goals.
- Now, after quitting my job, I'm reentering the world of software with renewed determination and a clear sense of purpose.

## My profile will be primarily focused on two key areas:

- 🌐 Projects in Full-Stack Web Development
- 💻 Solutions to Coding Challenges and Exercises

**In the past, I had a habit of solely taking courses and watching tutorials, which, as you might guess, did more harm than good. However, I've since adopted a [project-based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project-based_learning) approach.**

## I have a blog!

💬 [My blog](https://sorrowfulfloyd.wordpress.com)
is a reflection of my journey as I explore the field of software development.

You can expect to find:

- Insights and thoughts on my learning process
- Updates on projects I'm working on
- Tips and tricks I discover along the way
