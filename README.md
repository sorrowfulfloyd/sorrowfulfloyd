## About me

In the past, I was involved in electronics, doing component-level repairs on computers, TVs, and mobile phones from my repair shop. 

However, now I have closed my shop and want to be a wagie.

## My journey

A few years ago I dived into coding without a clear goal. Now I want to do this professionally like an NPC. Btw I heard React devs get paid a lot right? 

Oh, and I also remember *coding* VBasic 6.0 when I was a chubby little boy.
