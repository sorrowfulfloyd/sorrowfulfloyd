## About me

In the past, I was involved in electronics, doing component level repairs on computers, TVs, and mobile phones from my own repair shop. 

However, now I have closed my own shop and decided to dive into software development.

## My journey

Few years ago I dived into coding without a clear goal. Now I want to do this professionally like a NPC. Btw I heard React devs get paid a lot right? 

Oh and I also remember *coding* VS Basic when I was a chubby little boy.
