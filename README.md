## About me

In the past, I was involved in electronics, doing component-level repairs on computers, TVs, and mobile phones from my repair shop. 

However, now I have closed my shop and want to be a wagie.

## My journey

A few years ago, I dived into coding without a clear goal. Now, I want to do this professionally like an NPC. BTW I heard React devs get paid a lot, right? 

Oh, and I also remember *coding* in VBasic 6.0 when I was little, but my first ever introduction was in Turbo Pascal.
